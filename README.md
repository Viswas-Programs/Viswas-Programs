- 👋 Hi, I’m Viswas
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and ethical hacking
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and c++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that I make
- 📫 How to reach me: Nah I ain't givin' it

I am nub btw, so don't trash me when there is a bug in my program :)
NOTE: I am just a 8th standard kid, so I won't know 12std maths ;)

Also, as an advertisement for the collaboration of me and @North-west-wind, we are doing opensurviv.io
take a look at it and how it works <"https://github.com/NorthWestWind/opensurviv-client">
