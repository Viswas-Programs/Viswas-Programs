- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m HeheBoi420
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming (Game&OS Dev)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python and TS (C++ is on my wishlist) 

I am nub btw, so don't trash me when there is a bug in my programs :)
NOTE: I am just a 10th standard kid, so I won't know 12std maths ;)

std::cout << "print('And, not only learning how to write Hello world, I try to build projects with those 2 languages! :)')" << std::endl;

Also, as an advertisement for the revival of a popular IO game called surviv.io, done by @North-west-wind, we are doing islandr.io
take a look at it and how it works [here](https://github.com/North-West-Wind/islandr.io)
and if you can help out with it, please do it! (Even help with setting up servers too)

Also, there's another one to resurrect surviv.io, done by @hsanger, they are creating [Suroi](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi). Make sure to contribute to those too
