- 👋 Hi, I’m Viswas
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and ethical hacking
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and c++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on good projects (duh)
- 📫 How to reach me: Nah I ain't givin' it

I am nub btw, so don't trash me when there is a bug in my program :)
NOTE: I am just a 8th standard kid, so I won't know 12std maths ;)

Also, as an advertisement for the revival of a popular IO game called surviv.io, done by @North-west-wind, we are doing opensurviv.io
take a look at it and how it works [here (client)](https://github.com/North-West-Wind/opensurviv-client ) and here's the [server](https://github.com/North-West-Wind/opensurviv-server)
and if you can help out with it, please do it! (Even help with setting up servers too)

Also, there's another one to resurrect surviv.io, done by @hsanger, they are creating [SurvivReloaded](https://github.com/SurvivReloaded), [here's the client](https://github.com/SurvivReloaded/survivreloaded-client) and [here's the server](https://github.com/SurvivReloaded/survivreloaded-server). Make sure to contribute to those too
